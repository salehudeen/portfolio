    </p><h5>Why I Took The Program (Moringa)</h5>
    <p>There are lots off reasons why i wanted to learn coding ,I really dont know where to begin but first of all it all started in high school I got alot of influence from my computer teacher who studied IT he whenever i got the chance i would always ask him anyhting about technology even about the schools system as he was the one who designed it and is also the mind of it, secondly i noticed one time my dad came latef fro, his business and he was tired and I started thinking of an app idea for him that i tought would help him.at the end of the talk he was so exited and asked if there was an app like that and i said that its just an <em>IDEA</em> that made me wonder what if it wasnt an idea anymore what if i could make it a reality and help my Dad or even change my life thats the reason why i decided to join moringa</p>
